                    One Arizona was formed in 2010 as a direct response to the growing disenfranchisement of voters and to the attack on our Latino community in the form of SB1070.  Five years now, One Arizona has worked under a successful collaborative format on civic engagement efforts in statewide, gubernatorial, and municipality based election seasons. The table members represent a broad tapestry of 501c3s focused on voter registration, voter engagement, voter mobilization, election protection, and issue advocacy.
