                    One Arizona was formed in 2010 as a direct response to the growing disenfranchisement of voters and to the attack on our Latino community in the form of SB1070.  Five years now, One Arizona has worked under a successful collaborative format on civic engagement efforts in statewide, gubernatorial, and municipality based election seasons. The table members represent a broad tapestry of 501c3s focused on voter registration, voter engagement, voter mobilization, election protection, and issue advocacy.

                    This boom in the Latino population, combined with concerted and wide-ranging efforts to increase Latino voter registration and participation, have begun to shape the results the local, state and national elections.

              <h2>AZ Latinos: A Growing Share of All Votes Cast </h2>
                <br/>
                <br/>
              <p>
                 As further evidence that Latino voting clout is steadily increasing, in the past two AZ gubernatorial/mid-term elections (as well as the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections), Latino voters have represented a growing percentage of all ballots cast, and that trend is expected to continue in 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                 In the 2006 election, Latino voters accounted for 9 percent of all votes cast, according to county and state election records. In 2010, Latinos were 12 percent of all votes cast statewide. In 2014, One Arizona estimates Latinos will make up 14 percent or more of all votes cast.
              </p>
              <p>
                 Looking ahead to 2016, One Arizona estimates Latinos could represent 20 percent of all votes cast statewide in Arizona, though it is important to note that comparatively substantial increase is tied to the traditionally higher voter turnout among all voters in a presidential election year. For instance, Latino voters represented 18 percent of all the ballots cast in the 2012 presidential election year.
              </p>
              <p>
                 On the local election front, Latino voters have played a bigger role as well. In the election of Mayor Greg Stanton in Phoenix in 2012 Latino voter turnout increased three-fold over the previous mayoral election. In that same year, Daniel Valenzuela was elected to the Phoenix City Council by quintupling Latino voter turnout in his district. In addition, Latino voters are credited with helping to recall of Senator Russell Pearce and then defeat him in his bid for reelection to the State Senate. Much of the opposition to Pearceâ€™s election is rooted in the passage of Senate Bill 1070 and related immigration legislation.
