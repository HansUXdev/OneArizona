We demand for all work to be valued, we demand for affordable quality education, and we demand for our families to be united with every vote from our Communities."</p>

			<p>"My family immigrated to the United States with the dream that their children would have a better future. My parents believed that we would have a better opportunity to attain an education in the U.S.  Just like the 11 million undocumented families living in the U.S. Immigrating is like starting over, we have to adapt to a different culture, in which fear plays a big part in our lives. Currently, two of my siblings and I are protected under DACA. Obtaining DACA took the burden of fear from our daily lives. Remembering the sacrifice my father made on his journey to the U.S, inspires me and gives me the strength to continue to fight for a relief  for those who were  left out like my parents and my oldest sibling. Through organizing our community we ensure that Latinos continue stay civically engaged and continue to build power to obtain an immigration reform. "</p>

			<p>"As a community organizer in Phoenix, I see every day the need for economic justice in our schools and neighborhoods. I have student volunteers whose parents work in the service industry and make the current $8.05 Arizona minimum wage and itâ€™s not enough. These companies make more than enough pay their workers a living wage without passing on the cost to the consumer. This movement is not only about raising the minimum wage to $15, but to create a national movement to address income and wealth inequality in the U.S. The fact is that we are the wealthiest country in the world, but there are people who are working full-time who still live in poverty. That is fundamentally wrong and we are taking action to change that. We are strong and we will not stop until every worker has the dignity of a living wage."</p>
